# History of Creativity Final Project

_Codename: Octopus.  Because I Googled "most creative animal," and "octopus" was the top result._

## What 

I'm not sure what my project will be yet, but an Android app (maybe using Ionic?) would be cool!  Maybe something super simple like "remind me of something randomly n times a day."

## Why

It's required for the class.  I'd like to make an app because that's a skill I've been wanting to develop.

Todo: what problem am I trying to solve / how is my app going to help people?

## How

I'll put at least 30 minutes in per day until it's done.  I'll use the GitHub-Flow branching workflow to track changes, and I'll track ideas using GitHub Issues.
